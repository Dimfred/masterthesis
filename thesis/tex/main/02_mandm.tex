\chapter{Training and Experiments}

The following chapter describes the training process and the conducted experiments for the \ac{YOLOv4}-Tiny and for the \ac{MUnet}.
For both network the same train, validation and test split ratio of the data was used as described in section \ref{sec:data}.
In the training and validation dataset \acp{ECD} of 21 persons are present, where the same person can appear in both splits.
For the test dataset only persons were used which do not appear in the train nor in the validation dataset.
The detailed split ratio by images can be found in table \ref{tab:data_distribution} and the class based split ratio can be found in table \ref{tab:yolo_classes}.
