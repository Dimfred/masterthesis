In this section the data which was used in this thesis is presented, as well as some general information about that.
Generally, the dataset is a collection of \acp{ECD}, with \acp{ECC} in German notation.
The task was constrained to seven different \acp{ECC}, which are shown in figure \ref{fig:used_eccs}.
Most of the images are taken with a mobile phone, but some are also directly drawn on a digital device such as a tablet.
The difficulty of the task in this thesis increased gradually and more data was always acquired when the difficulty increased.
At first, only images of \acp{ECD} on a white background without annotations were gathered, when that showed promising results, additionally images of \acp{ECD} without annotation but on checkered background were gathered and finally when annotations were added both images with white and checkered background and annotations were acquired.
The total amount of images is show in table
