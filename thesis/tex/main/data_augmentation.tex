\acp{CNN} require a big amount of data to learn and to prevent the problem of overfitting, where a network perfectly learns the underlying data and isn't able to generalize over unseen data \cite{augmentation_survey}.
Augmentation is a way to artificially increase the amount of data.
In the image domain for example, images normally are transformed in various ways, like changing color parameters, rotating the image, or cropping parts of the image.
Other successful augmentation techniques like the copy-paste augmentation \cite{copypaste_aug} exists, which takes a segmentation mask of the underlying object and projects it on another background.
The copy-paste augmentation is highly used in this thesis, foremost to increase the number of \acp{ECD} with a checkered background.
