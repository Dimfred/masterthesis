\section{Motivation}

\section{Related Works}

The aim of this thesis is to provide a conversion pipeline for hand-drawn \acp{ECD} into the LTspice schematic file format.
To provide some context for the task, the following subsections present approaches related to the goal of this thesis.

- TODO general structure

\subsection{Classification of Eletrical Circuit Components}

G"unay et al. \cite{ecd_basecnn} compared in their work the accuracy of various common \ac{CNN} architectures trained on a dataset of hand-drawn \acp{ECC}.
The dataset consisted of four classes (resistor, capacitor, inductor, voltage source) and had overall a size of 863 images. best cnn 83\%

- fourier svm
- logical gates (AND, OR, NOT)
- segmentation of components based on closed region
- draw bbox around region
- feature extraction + svm
- 180 samples
- 83 \% accuracy
