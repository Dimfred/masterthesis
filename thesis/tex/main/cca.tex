- TODO later

A \ac{CCA} describes the process of labeling connected pixels in a binary image.

In the most simple case a structuring element such as a cross (four-connection-labeling) or a rectangle (eight-connection-labeling) is moved over an image and if two pixels are neighbors and their value is the same they are considered to have the same label. In this thesis the eight-connection-labeling algorithm by Grana et al. \cite{cca} is used.
