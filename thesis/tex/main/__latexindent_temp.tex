The softmax function takes as input the output of a previous layer and outputs a vector of pseudo probabilities by taking the fraction of the exponential function applied to an element of the input vector, divided by the sum of all exponential function outputs applied to all elements of the input vector.
The softmax function for each element is defined as:
