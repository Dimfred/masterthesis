\contentsline {table}{\numberline {2.10}{\ignorespaces The PANetTiny architecture which is a scaled version of PANet \cite {pannet}, which is the decoder in the YOLO network. It takes as inputs the skip connections from the CSPDarknet53Tiny. The network is build by alternating an output branch and an upsampling branch. First, the most lowest skip connection $Skip_L$ from the backbone is convolved and the output fed into the first output layer. Each output layer has again a $3\times 3$ convolution followed by a $1\times 1$ convolution, which form a raw bounding box prediction, fed to the YOLO head. After an output has been processed the previous convolution is again convolved and upsampled to be fed into the next output block. This is done three times in the whole PANetTiny network.\relax }}{26}{}%

\contentsline {table}{\numberline {2.13}{\ignorespaces \ac {MUnet} decoder. The decoder uses transpose convolutions to upsample the input (ConvTranspose) and as the backbone, inverted residuals to process the upsampled input together with the skip connection. The '+' indicates a concatenation along the channel axis. Since the first block in the backbone directly downsamples the input there is no skip connection with the size of the input. Therefore the last layer of the decoder is a upsampling layer, which uses a bilinear upsampling method to increase the size of the prediction to the size of the input. As with the backbone $t$ indicates the expansion size of the inverted residual block, $k$ indicates the used kernel size and $s$ indicates the used stride.\relax }}{35}{}%
